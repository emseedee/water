# water
A system to manage irrigation in a greenhouse on an allotment with no mains water or power.

Rainwater is collected into barrels, and solar panels are used to charge a 12V battery which powers the control system and a micro pump. 

V4 uses a Teensy LC single board computer, with analog controls.

V5 is a significant upgrade. The computer is an Arduino Nano Every, with a 20 x 4 char LCD display and 4 button membrane switch array.
